# Flutter Clean Architecture Example

This is a sample Flutter project that illustrates the Clean Architecture pattern, a software architectural approach that promotes separation of concerns and maintainability.

## Overview

The project is structured using Clean Architecture principles, which divide the codebase into several layers:

1. **Presentation Layer:** This layer contains UI components, including screens, widgets, and Flutter-specific code.
2. **Domain Layer:** Here, we define the business logic and use cases of the application. It includes the core business rules and entities.
3. **Data Layer:** This layer manages data sources, repositories, and data models. It handles data retrieval and storage.

## Features

- **Clean Separation of Concerns:** Clear separation between layers for better maintainability and testability.
- **Dependency Injection:** We use the `get_it` package for managing dependencies.
- **Sample Use Cases:** Includes sample interactions and use cases.
- **Organized Project Structure:** A well-organized structure for easy navigation and development.
